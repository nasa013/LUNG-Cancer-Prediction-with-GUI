# Lung Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project develops a **machine learning model** to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on patient data. The solution aims to facilitate **early detection** of lung cancer by using non-invasive, accessible patient information, thus improving the chances of timely intervention and improving survival rates. The model is integrated into a **desktop application** that allows healthcare providers to input patient data and receive immediate predictions.

## Key Features

- **Early Detection**: Predicts the likelihood of lung cancer based on non-invasive patient data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using **Tkinter** for easy patient data input and displaying prediction results.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Evaluates various machine learning algorithms such as **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, **Random Forest**, and **SVM** to identify the most effective for lung cancer prediction.
- **Model Integration**: The machine learning model is loaded using **Joblib** for prediction within the app.

## Problem Statement

Lung cancer often goes undiagnosed until it reaches advanced stages, mainly due to the late appearance of symptoms. Traditional diagnostic methods are costly and invasive. This project aims to develop a predictive tool that leverages **non-invasive patient data** to predict the likelihood of lung cancer, allowing for **early intervention** and reducing the cost and risk of late-stage diagnosis.

## Goals

- Develop a machine learning model to predict lung cancer based on patient data.
- Compare multiple ML algorithms to determine the best-performing model for lung cancer prediction.
- Create a practical desktop application to provide easy access to the prediction tool in healthcare settings.
- Share findings and contribute to research on the potential of machine learning in early cancer detection.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Tkinter (for GUI), Scikit-learn (for machine learning models), Joblib (for model persistence), NumPy, pandas
